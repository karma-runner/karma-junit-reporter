The unofficial to-do for karma-junit-reporter
=============================================

Planned milestones :

20.3.2016	Continuous testing ready for karma-junit-reporter
                 - adding tests to this project
                 - make them run the standard Travis way: in npm's package.json 'scripts' 
                   section, add the "test" command                

Also, check whether the PR coming from this fork (branch) fixes these issues: 
1. https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-junit-reporter/issues/81
   - needs sanity check of one variable, in a manner that might have to
     take into account the index is not numerable?
     - basically it's either 
        1.    if (x) ...
        2. or if (x && (typeof x[theIndex] !== undefined)) ... 

Specifics
=========

- in Travis
  - add a simple test spec, for my code of kjur, to make Travis fail first
    - this works as a kind of POC: "I got the test technically running!"
  - add the real tests case (1) to the chain of tests to be done
    - now a little bit of think-work would be nice. Does the test go for
      a) just checking the getClassName() 
      b) add some intelligence and conform to the ways this reporter is actually used?

- make sure the ./test folder is committed
- get filestuff right within the ./test
